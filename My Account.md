# My Account

## 1. Create new account
### How to create new account?
There are two steps to successfully create your DWP account.

**Step 1:**
Create your account with your work email.

A one time token will be sent to your work email. 

**Step 2:**
Check your email and enter the token. 

You will then need to enter a new password. The password has to be minimum 12 alphanumeric, with at least 1 upper case, 1 lower case, 1 numeral, and 1 with special character (e.g. *!?#).

### What if I never receive my one time token?
First, go to your Junk Email folder in your Outlook to see if it landed there.

If it's not there, go back to the Create Account view and enter your work email to receive the one time token again.

### I tried to create account but the app tells me I'm not available for registration yet.
First, please go back to the Create Account view and try to enter your work email again. Sometimes, it might have been due to accidental taps on other characters.

If it still fails, please contact your agency's IT helpdesk team.

### I tried to create account but the app tells me I have an existing account.
First, please go to Sign In view to try to sign in. Tap on "Forgot Password" if you have forgotten it.

If you are sure that you have never created an account before, please go back to the Create Account view and try to enter your work email again. Sometimes, it might have been due to accidental taps on other characters.

If it still fails, please contact your agency's IT helpdesk team.

### Is this the same account as My HR Kiosk?
Unfortunately, no.

The accounts are not linked for now. However, we are in works to allow access to transport claims and leave application on DWP Mobile. This means that you will eventually just need to interface with only one app.

We seek your patience and support!

## 2. Sign in

First, please ensure that you have typed in your work email and password correctly. Sometimes, it might have been due to accidental taps on other characters.
