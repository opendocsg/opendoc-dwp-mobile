# Technical Support

## 1. Supported devices
### Can I use it on Windows phone?
Unfortunately, we do not support Windows phone.

### Can I use it on tablet devices (e.g. iPad)?
You can download DWP Mobile app on the App Store or Play Store. However this app is not optimised for view on the iPad yet.

For best experience, we recommend it to use it on iPhones or Android phones.

## 2. Push Notification
### I'm not receiving Push Notifications on iOS
When you first sign in to the app, there will be a view to ask you to "Allow" the app to receive push notification.

If you have accidentally tap on "Don't Allow", go to your phone's Settings > Notifications > DWP Mobile to turn on the option for "Allow Notifications".

### I'm not receiving Push Notifications on Android
Push notifications are automatically allowed on Android.

Please go to your phone's Settings > Apps & Notifications > DWP Mobile to turn on the notification.


## 3. Contact
### Who can I ask for help?
