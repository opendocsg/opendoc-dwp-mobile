<h2 id="1-about-this-initiative">1. About this initiative</h2>

<h3 id="buying-things-for-work-can-be-as-easy-as-online-shopping-in-our-personal-lives">Buying things for work can be as easy as online shopping in our personal lives.</h3>
<p>Say hello to the <strong>Seamless E-commerce Purchase initiative</strong>, a project by Ministry of Finance and Government Technology Agency. With this initiative, public officers can make small value purchases (SVPs) in online malls by checking out with corporate billing.</p>

<p>How it works:
<img src="/opendoc-dwp-mobile/assets/img_svp_8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This initiative is currently in its <strong>pilot</strong> phase. Only agencies in the pilot phase will see the mini-apps.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you are a <strong>buyer</strong> using the <strong>E-commerce Order</strong> mini-app, refer to sections 2 to 8.</li>
  <li>If you are an <strong>approving officer</strong> using the <strong>E-commerce Order Approval</strong> mini-app, refer to section 9.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="which-are-the-participating-e-commerce-stores">Which are the participating e-commerce stores?</h3>
<p>Currently, Eezee and Shopee are the pilot stores for the initiative. More stores are on the way.</p>

<p>Your agency may not have subscribed to all the stores. Please approach your agency representative for more information.</p>

<h3 id="where-can-i-find-the-policy-details-for-this-initiative">Where can I find the policy details for this initiative?</h3>
<p>Please refer to the playbook or approach your agency representative for more information.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-e-commerce-order-and-e-commerce-order-approval-mini-apps">What is the difference between E-commerce Order and E-commerce Order Approval mini-apps?</h3>

<p><strong>E-commerce Order</strong> is for Small Value Purchase <strong>buyers</strong>. In this mini-app, they can set up corporate billing, view orders, amend order approval details and more.</p>

<p><strong>E-commerce Order Approval</strong> is for Small Value Purchase <strong>approving officers</strong> (AOs). In this mini-app, they can approve/reject pending e-commerce order requests. They can also see their SVP approval history.</p>

<p>Due to technical constraints, we cannot hide the approval mini-app from non-AOs. If you are not an AO, please ignore this mini-app.</p>

<h2 id="2-set-up-corporate-billing">2. Set up corporate billing</h2>

<h3 id="how-to-set-up-corporate-billing">How to set up corporate billing</h3>
<p>Before you start, make sure you have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a DWP mobile app account;</li>
  <li>an account on the participating e-commerce store; and</li>
  <li>(optional) <a href="https://mobilefaq.digitalworkplace.gov.sg/technical%20support#3-push-notification">turned on push notifications</a> for DWP Mobile for faster setup and be notified of order updates.</li>
</ul>

<p>The e-commerce account can be based on your personal email/phone number or a separate corporate account.</p>

<p><strong>Part 1: Enter work email address in e-commerce store</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Find the corporate billing setup option in the store.</li>
  <li>Enter your <strong>work email address</strong>, i.e. Singapore Public Service official email address. It usually ends with .gov.sg, but may differ for some agencies.</li>
  <li>You should see an image with the authentication instructions (see below). Continue to <strong>Part 2</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/opendoc-dwp-mobile/assets/img_svp_7.png" alt="Set up corporate billing screen" /></p>

<p><strong>Part 2: Authenticate using DWP Mobile</strong></p>

<p>Check if you have received a push notification on your mobile telling you to authenticate the corporate billing request.</p>

<p>If you received a push notification:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Tap on the push notification. You will see a screen with the message, <strong>Authenticate this request?</strong></li>
  <li>Tap <strong>Yes</strong>. If the authentication is successful, you will see a page with the message, <strong>Success!</strong>.</li>
  <li>(If you have not set up before) Tap <strong>Proceed to setup</strong> to set up your agency approval settings.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you did not receive a push notification:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the E-commerce order mini-app.</li>
  <li>Tap <strong>Accounts</strong>.</li>
  <li>Tap on the corporate billing request. You will see a screen with the message, <strong>Authenticate this request?</strong></li>
  <li>Tap <strong>Yes</strong>. If the authentication is successful, you will see a page with the message, <strong>Success!</strong>.</li>
  <li>(If you have not set up before) Tap <strong>Proceed to setup</strong> to set up your agency approval settings.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tip: the corporate billing request expires in 2 minutes. If that happens, you will need to set up corporate billing again at the e-commerce store.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-set-up-corporate-billing-on-any-e-commerce-store">Can I set up corporate billing on any e-commerce store?</h3>
<p>You can only set up corporate billing on participating e-commerce stores that your agency has subscribed to. Please approach your agency representative for more information.</p>

<h3 id="which-email-address-do-i-use-to-sign-up-for-an-account-with-the-store">Which email address do I use to sign up for an account with the store?</h3>
<p>It depends on the e-commerce store you are signing up for.</p>

<p>Some stores allow their users to use their personal account for corporate purchases. Others may need users to sign up for a separate corporate account using their work email.</p>

<h3 id="i-could-not-set-up-corporate-billing-with-my-work-email-address">I could not set up corporate billing with my work email address.</h3>

<p>This may be due to the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There was a typo in the email address. Please check that the email address was spelled correctly. If not, please re-enter the email address and try again.</li>
  <li>Your agency may not have subscribed to this mall. Please check with your agency for more information.</li>
  <li>There was an issue linking the corporate billing to your e-commerce account or work email. Please contact the e-commerce store or agency helpdesk for help.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="i-did-not-receive-a-push-notification-that-asks-me-to-authenticate-the-corporate-billing-request">I did not receive a push notification that asks me to authenticate the corporate billing request.</h3>
<p>The push notifications for DWP Mobile may have been turned off for your phone. <a href="https://mobilefaq.digitalworkplace.gov.sg/Technical%20Support.html#3-push-notification">See how you can turn on the notifications.</a></p>

<p>Note: if you did not receive a push notification, you can still set up corporate billing.</p>

<h3 id="my-corporate-billing-request-has-expired">My corporate billing request has expired.</h3>
<p>You will need to set up corporate billing again at the e-commerce store again.</p>

<p>Tip: corporate billing requests expire after 2 minutes. For a smoother setup process, ensure that your phone is ready at hand while you are setting up corporate billing.</p>

<h3 id="i-could-not-see-the-pending-corporate-billing-request-in-the-accounts-page">I could not see the pending corporate billing request in the Accounts page.</h3>
<p>This may be due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Accounts page was not updated. Pull down the page and release to refresh the page.</li>
  <li>Your corporate billing request has expired. You will have to set up corporate billing again.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: For a smoother setup process, ensure that your phone is ready at hand while setting up corporate billing.</p>

<h3 id="the-app-told-me-that-the-corporate-billing-setup-was-successful-but-i-did-not-see-the-corporate-billing-account-in-the-accounts-page">The app told me that the corporate billing setup was successful, but I did not see the corporate billing account in the Accounts page.</h3>
<p>This may be due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Accounts page was not updated. Pull down the page and release to refresh the page.</li>
  <li>Your corporate billing request has expired. You will have to set up corporate billing again.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: For a smoother setup process, ensure that your phone is ready at hand while setting up corporate billing.</p>

<h3 id="if-i-have-multiple-work-profiles-which-agency-will-my-corporate-billing-account-be-tied-to">If I have multiple work profiles, which agency will my corporate billing account be tied to?</h3>
<p>It depends on the agency you selected while setting up corporate billing in the E-commerce Order mini-app.</p>

<ol>
  <li>During corporate billing setup, you will see a page with the message, <strong>Authenticate this request?</strong></li>
  <li>Tap <strong>Agency</strong>.</li>
  <li>Choose the agency you want to tie the corporate billing account to.</li>
  <li>Tap <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm the corporate billing setup.</li>
</ol>

<p>Orders checked out using this corporate billing account will be tied to the agency you selected.</p>

<h2 id="3-setting-agency-approval-settings">3. Setting agency approval settings</h2>
<p>Your approval settings determine the approval process for your orders. This includes the cost centre, approving officer and approval routing options.</p>

<p>Approval settings are tied to the agency and not the corporate account itself.</p>

<p>Some buyers may be able to procure for multiple agencies. This happens if they hold positions in multiple agencies. In that case, there will be separate approval settings for each agency.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-dwp-mobile/assets/img_svp_5.png" alt="How settings look like if you have multiple agencies" /></p>

<h3 id="how-to-set-agency-approval-settings">How to set agency approval settings</h3>

<ol>
  <li>After setting up corporate billing successfully, you will see a page with the message, <strong>Success!</strong>.</li>
  <li>Tap <strong>Proceed to setup</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select your approving officer and frequently used cost centre.</li>
  <li>Choose the routing option you prefer.</li>
  <li>Tap <strong>Submit</strong>. Your preferences will be updated.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you do not see <strong>Proceed to setup</strong>, it means that you have previously set the approval settings for the agency. In this case, please refer to <a href="https://mobilefaq.digitalworkplace.gov.sg/e-commerce%20order.html#how-to-change-agency-approval-settings">How to change agency approval settings</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-change-agency-approval-settings">How to change agency approval settings</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab, and tap on the agency that you are changing settings for.</li>
  <li>Confirm your approving officer and frequently used cost centre.</li>
  <li>Choose the routing option you prefer.</li>
  <li>Tap <strong>Save Changes</strong>. Your preferences will be updated.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="do-i-have-to-set-up-my-agency-approval-settings-every-time-i-set-up-corporate-billing">Do I have to set up my agency approval settings every time I set up corporate billing?</h3>
<p>You do not need to. It is a one-time setup per agency.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-i-do-not-set-up-my-agency-approval-settings-at-all">What if I do not set up my agency approval settings at all?</h3>
<p>You can still check out with corporate billing in the e-commerce store. However, after checkout, the order will be sent to you first via DWP Mobile. You have to send the order to your approving officer manually.</p>

<h3 id="i-noticed-that-the-cost-centre-and-approving-officer-are-pre-filled-are-those-the-right-values">I noticed that the cost centre and approving officer are pre-filled. Are those the right values?</h3>
<p>The cost centre and approving officer fields are pre-filled based on the approval information we have. We recommend you to double check the values with your agency/finance representative.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-auto-routing-and-manual-routing">What is the difference between auto-routing and manual routing?</h3>
<p>The routing options affect the post-checkout process of your order.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Auto:</strong> After checkout, the order will be sent to the approving officer in your agency approval settings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Manual:</strong> After checkout, the order will be sent to you via DWP mobile. You will need to send the order to your approving officer manually in the details page of the order.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-app-told-me-that-my-cost-centreapproving-officer-is-not-valid-anymore">The app told me that my cost centre/approving officer is not valid anymore.</h3>
<p>This happens when:</p>
<ul>
  <li>your agency do not use the cost centre anymore;</li>
  <li>your approving officer is not in charge of this cost centre anymore; and/or</li>
  <li>your approving officer has left the agency.</li>
</ul>

<p>When this happens, select another cost centre or approving officer for your agency approval settings.</p>

<p>Note: if either cost centre or approving officer are invalid, orders you check out for that agency will be <strong>sent to you first</strong>, even if auto-approval was previously turned on.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-have-different-approval-settings-for-different-corporate-billing-accounts">Can I have different approval settings for different corporate billing accounts?</h3>
<p>You cannot have different approval settings for different corporate billing accounts. Approval settings are tied to your agency, and not to the corporate billing account.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-dwp-mobile/assets/img_svp_3.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="4-checkout-with-corporate-billing">4. Checkout with corporate billing</h2>

<h3 id="how-to-check-out-with-corporate-billing">How to check out with corporate billing</h3>

<ol>
  <li>During checkout, select corporate billing as the payment option.</li>
  <li>Enter the reason for purchase.</li>
  <li>Place the order.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-happens-after-checkout-do-i-need-to-do-anything">What happens after checkout? Do I need to do anything?</h3>
<p>After checkout, you should receive a push notification informing you about your order.</p>

<p>If you did not receive a push notification, you can check your order status in the E-commerce Order mini-app.</p>
