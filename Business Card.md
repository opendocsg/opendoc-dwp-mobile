Open your app to show the QR code for your counterpart to scan it.

Interestingly, we've also seen some users who use the personalised QR code image as their Lock Screen image!

### How to save contact if I'm using Android phone?

If you are using a third party QR code scanner, we noticed that some third party app is not able to open downloaded files. Please open the URL link in the phone's native browser or Chrome browser instead.
