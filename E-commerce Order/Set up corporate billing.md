# Set up corporate billing
### Can I set up corporate billing on any e-commerce store?
Nope, you can only set up corporate billing on participating e-commerce stores that your agency has subscribed to. Please approach your agency representative for more information.

### Which email address do I use to sign up for an account with e-commerce?
It depends on the e-commerce mall you are signing up for. 

Some malls allow their users to use their personal account for corporate purchases. Others may need users to sign up for a separate corporate account using their work email.

### How do I set up corporate billing?
Before you start, make sure you have:
* A DWP mobile app account, 
* An account on the participating e-commerce store, and
* (Optional) [Turned on push notifications](https://mobilefaq.digitalworkplace.gov.sg/technical%20support#3-push-notification) for DWP Mobile for faster setup and be notified of order updates.

The e-commerce account can be based on your personal email/phone number or a separate corporate account. 

**Part 1: Enter work email in e-commerce store**
1. Find the corporate billing setup option in the store. You can refer to the store's corporate billing setup guide.
2. Enter your **work email**, i.e. Singapore Public Service official email address. It usually ends with .gov.sg, but may differ for some agencies.
3. If you see the picture below, continue to **Part 2**. [Having issues?](https://mobilefaq.digitalworkplace.gov.sg/e-commerce%20order.html#i-could-not-set-up-corporate-billing-with-my-work-email-why)

**Part 2: Authenticate using DWP Mobile**

Check if you have received a push notification on your mobile telling you to authenticate the corporate billing request.

If you **received** a push notification:
1. Tap on the push notification.
2. Tap **Yes**. When you see a success page, it means your corporate billing account has been added successfully. 
3. (If you have not set up before) Tap **Proceed to setup** to set up your [agency approval settings](https://mobilefaq.digitalworkplace.gov.sg/e-commerce%20order.html#how-do-i-set-up-my-agency-approval-settings).

If you **did not receive** a push notification:
1. Open the E-commerce order mini-app.
2. Tap on **Accounts**.
3. Tap on the corporate billing request.
4. Tap **Yes**. When you see a success page, it means your corporate billing account has been added successfully. 
5. (If you have not set up before) Tap **Proceed to setup** to set up your [agency approval settings](https://mobilefaq.digitalworkplace.gov.sg/e-commerce%20order.html#how-do-i-set-up-my-agency-approval-settings).

The corporate billing request **expires in 2 min**. If it does, you will need to set up corporate billing again at the e-commerce store.


### I could not set up corporate billing with my work email. Why?

This may happen due to the following reasons:

* It could be a typo for your email. Please check the email entered and try again.
* Your agency may not have subscribed to this mall. Please check with your agency for more information.
* There was an issue linking the corporate billing to your e-commerce account or work email. Please contact the e-commerce store or agency helpdesk for help.

### I did not receive a push notification that asks me to authenticate the corporate billing request.
This may have happened because:

* You have turned off push notifications for DWP Mobile. [Turn on push notifications](https://mobilefaq.digitalworkplace.gov.sg/Technical%20Support.html#3-push-notification)
* Unknown technical issues. We are aware that some users do not receive push notifications even though they have turned on the notifications for the app. We are unsure why this happens, but we are working on it!

If you did not receive a push notification, you can still [set up corporate billing](https://mobilefaq.digitalworkplace.gov.sg/e-commerce%20order.html#how-do-i-set-up-corporate-billing).

### The app tells me that my corporate billing request has expired.
If it expires, you will need to set up corporate billing again at the e-commerce store again. 

Corporate billing requests expire after **2 min**. For a smoother setup process, ensure that your phone is ready at hand while you are setting up corporate billing.

### I cannot see the pending corporate billing request in the Accounts page.
This may have happened because:
* The Accounts page has not been updated. 
* Your corporate billing request has expired.

Try refreshing the Accounts page by pulling down and releasing the page. If that does not work, try setting up corporate billing again at the e-commerce store. 

For a smoother setup process, ensure that your phone is ready at hand while you are setting up corporate billing.

### The app tells me that the corporate billing setup was successful, but I do not see the corporate billing account in the Accounts page.
This may have happened because:
* The Accounts page has not been updated. 
* There were errors on the e-commerce storeâ€™s end. 

Try refreshing the Accounts page by pulling down and releasing the page. If that does not work, try setting up corporate billing again at the e-commerce store. 

### If I have multiple work profiles, which agency will my corporate billing account be tied to?
It depends on the agency you select during corporate billing setup in the E-commerce Order mini-app.

1. Tap on the **Agency** field.
2. Choose the agency you want to tie the corporate billing account to.
3. Tap **Yes**.

Orders checked out using this corporate billing account will be tied to the agency you selected for the account.
