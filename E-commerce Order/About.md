### What's the difference between E-commerce Order and E-commerce Order Approval mini-apps?

**E-commerce Order** is for Small Value Purchase **buyers**. In this mini-app, they can set up corporate billing, view orders, amend order approval details and more.

**E-commerce Order Approval** is for Small Value Purchase **approving officers** (AOs). In this mini-app, they can approve/reject pending e-commerce order requests. They can also see their SVP approval history.

Due to technical constraints, we cannot hide the approval mini-app from non-AOs. If you are not an AO, please ignore this mini-app.
