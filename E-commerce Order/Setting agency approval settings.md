## Setting agency approval settings
### How do I set up my agency approval settings?
**Option 1. After you set up corporate billing for the first time**

In the **corporate billing setup success** page:
1. Tap on the **Proceed to setup** button. 
2. Select your approving officer and frequently used cost centre.
3. Choose the routing option you prefer.
4. Tap **Submit**. Your preferences will be updated.

If you do not see the Proceed to Setup button, it means that you have previously set the approval settings for the agency. In this case, see option 2 to know how to change your agency approval settings.

**Option 2. Any time, at the Settings page**

Refer to [Can I change my agency approval settings after the initial setup?](https://mobilefaq.digitalworkplace.gov.sg/e-commerce%20order.html#can-i-change-my-agency-approval-settings-after-the-initial-setup).

### Do I have to set up my agency approval settings every time I set up corporate billing?
Nope, it is a one-time setup per agency.

### What if I do not set up my agency approval settings at all?
You can still check out with corporate billing in the e-commerce store. However, after checkout, the order will be sent to you first via DWP Mobile. You have to [send the order to your approving officer](https://mobilefaq.digitalworkplace.gov.sg/e-commerce%20order.html#how-do-i-send-my-order-to-the-approving-officer-for-approval) manually.

### I noticed that the cost centre and approving officer are pre-filled. Are those the right values?
The cost centre and approving officer fields are pre-filled based on the approval information we have. We recommend you to double check the values with your agency/finance representative.

### What is the difference between auto-routing and manual routing?
The routing options affect the post-checkout process of your order.

**Auto** - After checkout, the order will be sent to the approving officer in your agency approval settings. 

**Manual** - After checkout, the order will be sent to you via DWP mobile. You will need to [send the order to your approving officer](https://mobilefaq.digitalworkplace.gov.sg/e-commerce%20order.html#how-do-i-send-my-order-to-the-approving-officer-for-approval) manually in the Details page.

### Can I change my agency approval settings after the initial setup?
Yes, you can change your approval settings in the E-commerce Order mini-app.

1. Go to the **Settings** tab and tap on the agency that you are changing settings for.
2. Confirm your approving officer and frequently used cost centre.
3. Choose the routing option you prefer.
4. Tap **Save Changes**. Your preferences will be updated.

### The app tells me that my cost centre/approving officer is not valid anymore.
These errors show when:
* Your agency do not use the cost centre anymore;
* Your approving officer is not in charge of this cost centre anymore, and/or
* Your approving officer has left the agency.

When this happens, **select another** cost centre or approving officer for your agency approval settings.

Note: If either cost centre or approving officer are invalid, orders you check out for that agency will be **sent to you first**, even if auto-approval is on.

### Can I have different approval settings for different corporate billing accounts?
Nope. Approval settings are tied to your agency, and not to the corporate billing account.
